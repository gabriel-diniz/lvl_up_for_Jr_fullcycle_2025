Hi!

In this project, i developed, with Luiz Carlos from Full Cycle, a selling tickets system.

What i learned that is the most important was the concepts:
# Design Partners 
# SOLID
# Best praties of developing systems
# Deploy
# MVC Architecture
# API's Design
# Concurrent database access
# Scalable and easy to maintain code

and improved what i've already know about: 
# Linux (WSL2)
# Javascript
# Node.js
# Express / node.js
# Typescript
# Docker
# MySQL
# REST Client

The first step was to built the role system without the concepts.

Node.js 
npm init -y: creates a package.json

Typescript
npx tsc --init creates a tsconfig.json

Express
npm install express
